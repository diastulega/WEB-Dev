        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Shymbulak (also known as "Chimbulak") was discovered by amateur skiers in the 1940s. Soon after, it became the first downhill route in the Soviet Union. Skiers originally needed to climb up the mountain tops on foot (which took roughly 3 hours). In 1954 a 1500 meters ski tow was built</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Lake Kaindy is located in the south of Kazakhstan, within Kolsay Lakes National Park. It is located 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) above sea level, 130 kilometres (81 mi) east of Almaty. The lake was formed as the result of a major limestone landslide triggered by the 1911 Kebin earthquake forming a natural dam. It blocked the gorge and was filled by mountain river water. Lake Kaindy is about 400 meters long, reaching depths of nearly 30 meters at its deepest point. Altered by limestone deposits, the water maintains a bluish-green color.</p>
